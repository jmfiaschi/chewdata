## The structure

The configuration is composed by a list of steps :

* List of steps
  * Step 1
  * Step 2
  * ...
  * Step N

Example in json:

```json
[
    { 
        "type": "reader"
    },
    {
        "type": "writer"
    },
    {
        "type": "transformer"
    },
    ...
]
```

## Order

The application read steps in `FIFO` (First In First Out) mode.

## Behaviour

All steps are link together by internal data queue. When a step finish to handle a data, it is pushed in the queue and the next step will handle the data.
Each steps run in asynchronous.
Each queue contain a limit that can be customize. 
If a queue reach the limit, the step wait that the queue is released by the next step.
